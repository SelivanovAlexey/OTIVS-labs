# OTIVS-labs

Current repo contains 3 labs:

* First lab doesn't have any logic relying on knowledge base and production rules. It is implemented in simple if-else algorithm.

* Second lab uses Knowledge Base class, contains array of production rules. The program algorithm relies on this array. Array is located in the code, so it is unavailable to modify

* Third lab uses connection with MongoDB database located in the cloud cluster, which contains set of production rules. In this case, we can modify rules and it will not impact program functionality.
